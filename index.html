					<h1>About me</h1>
					<h3>Web Designer, Developer, Service Extraordinaire...</h3>
					<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Experience, creativity and passion are characteristics I portray and they are active elements to my DNA.</p>
					<p><strong>Creativity:</strong> Early on, I adopted a school of thought that aims to raise the bar with every new project that comes through my front door. “Run of the mill” has no place within my mind. This type of thinking has kept my design and development on the front lines of web technology, always looking to produce something new and creative.</p>
					<p><strong>Delivery:</strong> On time and on budget – that’s my mantra. My detailed project initiation process lends to my ability to finish and launch projects on time and on budget.</p>
					<p><strong>Integrity:</strong> I take my role as a leader in the technology based business community very seriously and am committed to maintaining the highest level of integrity and professionalism.</p>
